## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the Reproducible Research peer-graded Assignment 1.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
```

Loading and pre-processing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")
ActData <- read.csv("activity.csv", na.strings = "NA")
ActData$date <- as.Date(as.character(ActData$date), format = "%Y-%m-%d")
ActData$year <- year(ActData$date)
ActData$month <- month(ActData$date)
ActData$day <- day(ActData$date)
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  

1.Total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
TotalStepsPerDay <- group_by(ActData, year, month, day) %>%
    summarise(daily_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ungroup()
head(TotalStepsPerDay)
```

2.Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(TotalStepsPerDay$daily_steps, main = "Total number of steps per day", col = "skyblue", breaks = 10, xlab = "Total number of steps (per day)")
```

3.The **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day is **`r round(mean(TotalStepsPerDay$daily_steps), 2)`** and **`r median(TotalStepsPerDay$daily_steps)`** respectively.  

### What is the average daily activity pattern?
1.Time series plot 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
IntActData <- group_by(ActData, interval) %>% 
    summarise(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ungroup()
with(IntActData, plot(interval, steps, type = "l", main = "Average number of steps", xlab = "Average number of steps taken, averaged across all days", ylab = "5-minute interval"))
```   
  
2.The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set with the maximum number of steps is **`r IntActData[IntActData$steps == max(IntActData$steps),1]`**  

### Imputing missing values  
1.The total number of missing values is `r sum(is.na(ActData))`  
2.Imputing missing values based on the 5-minute interval mean.  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ImpActData <- group_by(ActData, interval) %>% 
    mutate(steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), steps)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(ImpActData)
```
  
3.Total number of steps taken per day (without missing data)  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
TotalStepsPerDay1 <- group_by(ImpActData, year, month, day) %>%
    summarise(daily_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ungroup()
head(TotalStepsPerDay1)
```
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(TotalStepsPerDay1$daily_steps, main = "Total number of steps per day", col = "skyblue", breaks = 10, xlab = "Total number of steps (per day)")
```
  
4.The **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day (with missing values filled) is **`r as.character(round(mean(TotalStepsPerDay1$daily_steps), 2))`** and **`r as.character(round(mean(TotalStepsPerDay1$daily_steps), 2))`** respectively. Yes, these estimates differ from what we got in the first past of the assignment. The mean and meadian estimates have increased after the missing values imputation.  

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
  
1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ImpActData$weekstatus <- ifelse(weekdays(ImpActData$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
```  
  
2.Panel plot
```{r, echo=TRUE}
IntImpActData <- group_by(ImpActData, interval, weekstatus) %>% 
    summarise(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
xyplot(steps ~ interval| weekstatus, data = IntImpActData, layout = c(1, 2), type ="l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
